# Web Development Exercise - Perfume (FrontendMentor)
I post my web development exercises here to track my improvement. If you want to give me advice on my codes feel free to leave a comment.
Today I recreated a beginner website that I chose from the Frontend Mentor. I couldn't access some of the fonts they provided so I didn't change the fonts and went through a more original pathway. I thought that if I manage to position my divs and the other stuff the website has, that's enough self-satisfaction for me. Rest is just design anyways.
I think I didn't fully succeed in positioning of the main content div, I wanted it to retain its position even if I change the screen size but it's obvious that I'm still not sure about how to manage that kind of positioning. I'll work on that, I have something in my mind. Still, I didn't want to change my project's code to try that out because other than this positioning issue, it was working pretty well. 
Also, I'm aware that I used some extra unneccessary code, like using span inside my div etc but I still did it because it didn't seem like a problem. Later, I didn't change it neither because my website was working good enough and I didn't want to screw up the positioning I made. 

It was a fun project to follow, even If it's a beginner exercise. I plan to review projects and codes to improve myself, I believe I'll become more and more skilled and gain speed as the time passes. Thanks for your attention.
